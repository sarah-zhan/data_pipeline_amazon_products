# Data Pipeline - Amazon Products

## Problem statement
We have a dataset that was scrapped from the internet, which includes Amazon products in 2023. You are tasked to extract the data information and upload them to BigQuery. It is also required to develop a dashboard to visulize the data to the users.
The data is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset).

## Requirements
1. Data Extraction from data sources, such as databases, csv files, or APIs.
2. Data masking: If sensitive information exist
3. Data loading to BigQuery: Design a process to securely load the data to google storage bucket and BigQuery (Batching or Streaming)
4. Transform the data
5. Dashboard Visulization (need 2 tiles)
